## Personal Portfolio Webpage

This page is a portfolio for articles I have written about the statistical analysis of wine.

I built this front-end page based on work I did to complete the freeCodeCamp assignment [Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) in the Responsive Web Design certification.
