# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects
## Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

I built this front-end page to complete the freeCodeCamp assignment [Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) in the Responsive Web Design certification.

The formal assignment is submitted in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ewotawa/full/mdPOvBd).
